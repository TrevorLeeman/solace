# Development Discussion

## Initial Setup Changes

### Environment Security
**Change Made**: Added `.env` to `.gitignore` and created `.env.example`

**Rationale**: The starter code included a `.env` file with database credentials. While these are local development credentials, establishing proper secret management practices from the start demonstrates security awareness. This change ensures:
- Credentials never enter version control history
- Each developer can maintain their own local configuration
- Production deployments can use proper secret management without code changes

**Implementation**:
- Modified `.gitignore` to explicitly exclude `.env` 
- Created `.env.example` with placeholders to document required environment variables
- Preserves the existing commented DATABASE_URL for optional database setup
